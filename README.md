## 🚧 Current Status: Proof-of-Concept

As it stands, this bot serves as a basic proof-of-concept built over a week-end. While functional, automating the entire process without tying up your computer requires further optimization.

Considerations for future enhancements:

- Exploring the possibility of using cloud instances with GPUs.
- Implementing a more dynamic path configuration instead of the current hardcoded paths based on my laptop setup.

**Additional Information:**

- The game was installed using CurseForge.
- The modpack used is `[FABRIC] Boosted FPS`, it includes various optimizations and shaders

## ⚙️ Configuration

To configure the bot, modify the **.env** file:

```
USERNAME=your_account_username
UUID=your_account_username_uuid
ACCESS_TOKEN=account_access_token
CLIENT_ID=
XUID=

SCREENSHOTS_DIR_PATH=/path/where/the/screenshots/are/saved/

MASTODON_SERVER=https://my.instance.example
MASTODON_CLIENT_ID=
MASTODON_CLIENT_SECRET=
MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=

R2_BUCKET_NAME=
R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=

// Available: "static", "openai". Default to "static".
DESCRIBER_SERVICE=

// Not required if DESCRIPTION != "openai"
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To simplify the configuration process, launch your Minecraft game as usual. Then, capture the command line used to run the game, for instance using `ps aux`. This will provide the exact details required for the bot's setup.
